# financial_news_sentiment_analysis (NLP Project)
Predictive analysis of news headlines for sentiment classes 
# Introduction
This project's aim, is to explore the world of Natural Language Processing (NLP) by building what is known as a Sentiment Analysis Model. A sentiment analysis model is a model that analyses a given piece of text and predicts whether this piece of text expresses positive, neutral, or negative sentiment.
To this end, we will be using the Financial News headlines data collected from the perspective of a retail investor. The texts in the headlines form semantic orientation of the sentences help machine to train and evaluate applied models. 

I will begin with a series of cleaning and data processing, ranging from removing icons to lemmatization, then I will apply to vectorize text data using TF-IDF transformer, and finally run the fully vectorized data into Logistic Regression and Random Forest model. This model's goal would be to properly classify positive, neutral or negative tweets in terms of sentiment. Next, we will propose a much more advanced solution using a deep learning model: Dense Layer Model. Here, we will discover, Function, Dropout and many other machine learning related concepts.
